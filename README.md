Some exercises on Machine Learning

Currently developed in Octave.

Implemented a linear gradient descent algorithm. 
I implemented an algorithm to change the learning parameter alpha to reduce iterations. It works but isn't quite right as it continuously keeps changing it (up and down as you can see from the pic).
